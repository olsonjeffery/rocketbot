### The IRC bot

[Here](http://github.com/olsonjeffery/rocketbot) is the source repository for `rocketbot`. It is written entirely in [Boo](http://boo.codehaus.org), and utilizes a rudimentary DSL syntax for specifying script-based extensions. Examples of `rocketbot` scripts can be fond in the `src/Scripts` directory.
